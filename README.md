# Sui Sequencer
This repo is an experiment to create a sequencer for FastPay that allows the aggregation of transactions into a block of 'batched' transactions.

Through such methods, we can reduce the amount of EC point operations by thousands of times, as well as save massive amounts of bandwidth.
